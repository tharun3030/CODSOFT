#### Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction

**Project Overview**  
This project involves building a predictive model to identify customers who are at risk of churning from a subscription-based service. Using historical customer data, the model aims to capture patterns of usage behavior and demographics to understand factors that contribute to customer churn. This information can help businesses improve retention strategies and address customer needs proactively.

**Technologies Used**  
- Python
- Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
- Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

**Dataset**  
The dataset contains customer demographic information and usage patterns. It can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanudhakadd/bank-customer-churn-prediction).

**Key Highlights**  
- Preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical data.
- Built multiple models and compared their performance to find the most accurate and reliable model.
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics, helping to interpret the results for business insights.


#### Task 4: Spam SMS Detection

**Project Overview**  
This project focuses on developing an AI model to classify SMS messages as either spam or legitimate. The goal is to create a system that can filter out unwanted spam messages and improve user experience in messaging applications. The model leverages natural language processing techniques to analyze message content and predict its category.

**Technologies Used**  
- Python
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): TF-IDF, Word Embeddings
- Machine Learning Algorithms: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines
- Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score

**Dataset**  
The dataset consists of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham (legitimate) and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset).

**Key Highlights**  
- Performed text preprocessing, including tokenization and vectorization using TF-IDF.
- Implemented multiple classification algorithms to identify the most effective model for spam detection.
- Evaluated models using metrics like precision and recall to ensure high accuracy in spam classification.
